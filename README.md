# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

A comprehensive and interactive HR dashboard built using Tableau. This project visualizes key employee data to provide insights into workforce demographics, hiring trends, salaries, and performance metrics.

Inspired by a tutorial from [Data with Baara (Baraa Khatib Salkini)](https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa), this project helped me enhance my Tableau skills and understand best practices for real-world HR analytics dashboards.
